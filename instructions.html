        <h3>Read the instructions carefully before starting a game</h3>
        <p>The Simon game is a classic memory game that involves remembering and repeating sequences of colors and
            sounds.
            Here are the basic steps to play the Simon game:</p>
        <div>
            <ol type="1">
                <li><span>Understand the Game Components:</span>The game consists of a circular device with four colored
                    sections with different colors.</li>
                <li><span>Start a Game:</span>Press any keyboard button to begin a new game.</li>
                <li><span>Watch the Pattern:</span>After pressing the key a flash will automatic appear on any of the
                    individual color. Pay attention to the pattern of colors. The game will start with a single color
                    flash.</li>
                <li><span>Repeat the Pattern:</span>After Simon has blink a color, repeat the same sequence by pressing
                    the corresponding colored sections on which the flash occured in step3. For example, if Simon plays
                    red, blue, green, you should press red, blue, green in the same order.</li>
                <li><span>Advance to the Next Round:</span>If you successfully repeat the pattern, Simon will add
                    another flash to the sequence for the next round.</li>
                <li><span>Continue the Game:</span>Keep repeating the patterns as Simon adds more flashes. The game
                    becomes progressively challenging as the sequences get longer.</li>
                <li><span>Game Over:</span>If you make a mistake and fail to repeat the correct sequence, the game will
                    end, and you will have to start over.</li>
                <li><span>Levelkeeping:</span>Some versions of the Simon game keep track of your level. The goal is to
                    see how far you can go without making a mistake.</li>
                <li><span>Challenge Yourself:</span>To improve your memory and concentration, try to do best your with
                    your maximum level in each game.</li>
                <li><span>Turn Off the Game:</span>When you're done playing, turn off the Simon game.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Remember, the key to success in the Simon game is to focus, observe, and remember the sequence of colors
                and sounds. As the game progresses, the sequences become more complex, making it a fun and challenging
                exercise for memory and concentration.</p>
